\title{Calculate RD test statistic}
\usage{
test_RD(x_E, x_C, n_E, n_C, delta, better = c("high", "low"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x_E}{Vector of number of events in experimental group.}

\item{x_C}{Vector of number of events in control group.}

\item{n_E}{Sample size in experimental group.}

\item{n_C}{Sample size in control group.}

\item{delta}{Non-inferiority margin.}

\item{better}{"high" if higher values of x_E favour the alternative 
hypothesis and "low" vice versa.}
}
\value{
Vector of values of the RD test statistic.
}
\description{
\code{test_RD} returns the value of the Farrington-Manning test statistic
for non-inferiority of the risk difference between two proportions.
}
\details{
If higher values of $x_E$ favour the alternative hypothesis, we are interested
in testing the null hypothesis
$$H_0: p_E - p_C \le \delta ,$$
where the NI-margin is usually non-positive: $\delta \le 0$.
The test statistic for this hypothesis is
$$T_{\RD, \delta}(x_E, x_C) = \frac{\hat p_E - \hat p_C - \delta}{\sqrt{\frac{\tilde p_E(1 - \tilde p_E)}{n_E} + \frac{\tilde p_C(1 - \tilde p_C)}{n_C}}},$$
where $\tilde p_C = \tilde p_C(x_E, x_C)$ is the MLE of $p_C$ and
$\tilde p_E = \tilde p_C + \delta$ is the MLE of $p_E$ under $p_E - p_C = \delta$.
High values of $T_{\RD, \delta}$ favour the alternative hypothesis.
